    <section>
      <p>This Privacy Policy explains what information <strong>Cross Cribbage</strong> ("the App", "we", "us", or "our") collects, how it is used, and the choices you have regarding that information. By using the App you consent to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We keep data collection minimal. The App uses the services listed below which may collect and process certain information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Anonymous Firebase Authentication</strong> — The App uses Firebase Authentication to create anonymous user accounts. These accounts generate unique identifiers used to associate player sessions and game state while preserving user anonymity. We do not require you to sign up with an email address or other personal credentials.</li>
      <li><strong>Google Analytics for Firebase</strong> — We use Google Analytics to gather aggregate usage statistics (e.g., session length, device type, feature usage). This helps us understand how people use the App and improve it.</li>
      <li><strong>AdMob (Google)</strong> — The App displays advertisements through AdMob. AdMob may collect data used for ad personalization (see <em>Ads</em> below).</li>
      <li><strong>Google Play Billing / Play Services</strong> — If you make in-app purchases, Google Play handles billing and receipt data. We do not access your payment credentials.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Location</h2>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> request precise GPS location. Google Analytics / AdMob may collect <em>approximate location</em> (city/region inferred from IP) to better measure and serve content and advertising. We do not use precise location tracking within the App.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide and maintain the App, including anonymous player session management (via Firebase Auth).</li>
      <li>To analyze usage trends and improve app features (via Google Analytics).</li>
      <li>To serve and manage advertisements (via AdMob).</li>
      <li>To process in-app purchases and manage entitlements (via Google Play Services).</li>
      <li>To respond to support requests sent to <a href="mailto:mitchellmayapps@gmail.com">mitchellmayapps@gmail.com</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Ads & Advertising Choices</h2>
    <p>The App shows ads provided by AdMob. Ads may be personalized using signals such as approximate location and device identifiers. If you prefer not to receive personalized ads, you can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Visit <a href="https://adssettings.google.com">Google Ads Settings</a> to opt out of personalized advertising.</li>
      <li>Use your device-level setting to opt out of ad personalization (Android → Settings → Google → Ads → Opt out of Ads Personalization).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing & Third Parties</h2>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell or share personal data to third parties for advertising or marketing purposes. The third-party services we use (Firebase, Google Analytics, AdMob, Google Play) will process data under their respective privacy policies. We recommend reviewing:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">Firebase Privacy & Security</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543">AdMob privacy</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Storage & Retention</h2>
    <p>Game state and session data (associated with anonymous Firebase accounts) are stored in Firebase/Firestore for the purpose of gameplay, matchmaking and rejoin functionality. We retain data as needed for app functionality and to comply with legal obligations. If you stop using the App, your anonymous account and associated game data may be retained until it is automatically removed or until retention rules are applied (for example, abandoned games may be cleaned up periodically).</p>

    <h2>7. Account Deletion & User Controls</h2>
    <p>The App uses anonymous Firebase accounts and does not collect or store traditional user-managed profiles (name, email) within our systems. At this time there is <strong>no built-in in-app account deletion feature</strong>. If you wish to stop using the App and remove locally stored data, you may uninstall the App from your device. If you have questions about data removal or retention, contact <a href="mailto:mitchellmayapps@gmail.com">mitchellmayapps@gmail.com</a> and we will evaluate reasonable requests on a case-by-case basis.</p>

    <h2>8. Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect data associated with the App from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction. Firebase and Google services provide industry-standard security infrastructure. However, no transmission or storage system is 100% secure—please understand that absolute security cannot be guaranteed.</p>

    <h2>9. Children</h2>
    <p>The App is not specifically targeted at children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal data from a child under 13 without parental consent, we will take steps to delete that data. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with information, please contact <a href="mailto:mitchellmayapps@gmail.com">mitchellmayapps@gmail.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>10. International Transfers & Legal Bases</h2>
    <p>Data processed by Google (Firebase/Analytics/AdMob) may be transferred to and stored in servers located in the United States and other countries. If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), our legal basis for processing (analytics & app functionality) includes legitimate interests in operating and improving the App and fulfilling contractual obligations related to in-app purchases and gameplay.</p>

    <h2>11. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights under local law (for example GDPR or CCPA). These may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Accessing the data we hold about you</li>
      <li>Requesting correction of inaccurate data</li>
      <li>Requesting deletion of certain data (subject to applicable limitations)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact <a href="mailto:mitchellmayapps@gmail.com">mitchellmayapps@gmail.com</a>. We will respond in accordance with applicable law.</p>

    <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will post the revised policy in the App and update the “Effective date” above. Continued use of the App after such changes indicates acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>13. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact:</p>
    <p><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:mitchellmayapps@gmail.com">mitchellmayapps@gmail.com</a></p>
